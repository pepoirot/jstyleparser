This directory contains the libraries used by jStyleParser. For testing purposes,
we have used the NekoHTML parser and the Xerces DOM implementation that is contained
in the following packages:

nekohtml.jar
xecesImpl.jar
xml-apis.jar

These packages may be replaced by any other standard DOM implementation used
in your project.
