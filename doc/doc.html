<h1>jStyleParser</h1>
<p>
jStyleParser is a Java library for parsing CSS style sheets and assigning styles to the HTML or XML
document elements according to the W3C CSS 2.1 specification. The result of the parsing
is a mapping between the DOM elements and the corresponding CSS declarations. This mapping can be used 
either for displaying the HTML document or for performimg some further analysis on 
the document structure.
</p>
 
<h2>Internal Structure of the Library</h2>
The code is divided into following packages:
<ol>
	<li><code>cz.vutbr.web.css</code>,</li>
	<li><code>cz.vutbr.web.csskit</code>,</li>
	<li><code>cz.vutbr.web.domassign</code> and</li>
	<li><code>test</code>.
</ol>
<p>
The first package provides in general the contracts used in other applications,
the second one contains its implementation. The third package is about assigning
CSS rules to HTML elements. The last one contains test units.
</p> 

<h3>Package <code>cz.vutbr.web.css</code></h3>
<p>
In addition to several implementation interfaces, this package provides a general entry
point of the jStyleParser library. It is the <code>CSSFactory</code> class.
By default, the interfaces use an implementation provided by <code>cz.vutbr.csskit</code>
package.
</p>
<p>
Another remarkable class in this package is the <code>CSSProperty</code> interface, which provides 
a base for CSS properties. By implementing this interface, new CSS properties can be added.
</p>

<h3>Package <code>cz.vutbr.web.csskit</code></h3>
<p>
This pcakage provides a default implementation of <code>cz.vutbr.web.css</code>. This can be changed by
registering other implementation by calling the appropriate methods of <code>CSSFactory</code>. 
</p>
<p>
Internally, it uses <a href="http://www.antlr.org"">ANTLR</a> to parse CSS input into structures 
defined by contracts in the package <code>cz.vutbr.web.css</code>.
</p>

<h3>Package <code>cz.vutbr.web.domassign</code></h3>
<p>
This package provides among others an <code>Analyzer</code> class,
which is able sort the CSS declarations, to classify them according to a CSS medium and
finally, to assign them to the DOM elements.
</p> 
<p>
The transformation core is implemented in the <code>DeclarationTransformer</code> class.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, this package provides the <code>TreeWalker</code> traversals to simplify 
traversing a DOM tree obtained by the DOM parser, such as <code>Tidy</code> used in 
this implementation.

<h2>User Guide</h2>
<h3>Retrieving a style sheet structure (<code>StyleSheet</code>)</h3>
<p> 
This functionality should be used only if some advanced work is desired, such as caching 
results for different media.
<br/>
Three methods are defined:
<ul>
	<li><code><b>StyleSheet parse(URL url, String encoding)
			throws CSSException, IOException</b></code>, the most general method. 
			Transforms data available at the given <code>url</code>, expecting given <code>encoding</code>,
			or taking the default one if it is not provided.,			
	</li>
	<li><code><b>StyleSheet parse(String fileName, String encoding)
			throws CSSException, IOException</b></code>, which internally transforms the
			<code>fileName</code> into an URL and		
	</li>
	<li><code><b>StyleSheet parse(String css) throws IOException,
			CSSException</b></code>, which can be used to parse embedded CSS declarations, 
			that is declarations between the &lt;style&gt; tags.
	</li>
</ul>
The resulting <code>StyleSheet</code> cen be used as the input for <code>Analyzer</code>.
</p>

<h3>Analyzing a Style Sheet</h3>
<p>When a <code>StyleSheet</code> instance is retrieved in the previous step, it can be passed to an <code>Analyzer</code>.
This object classifies rules into groups by CSS media and according to their CSS selectors. This operation is done
only once during the construction of the <code>Analyzer</code> and all the subsequent requests are executed on maps created 
during this classification.
This will lead to light overhead when only a single CSS medium type is used, but it greatly improves the performance
when one CSS style-sheet has to be analyzer from to point of view of different media.  
</p>
<p>
The <code>Analyzer</code> basically provides following method:
<ul>
	<li><code><b>Map&lt;Element, NodeData&gt; evaluateDOM(Document doc, String medium,
			final boolean inherit)</b></code>, which constructs a map between DOM elements 
			and their CSS declarations according to the given <code>medium</code> and
			allowed/disabled inheritance of declarations. 
	</li>
</ul>  
</p>

<h3>Retrieving the Values of DOM Elements</h3>
<p> 
When the analyzing part is done for the style sheet, a mapping between DOM elements and
the <code>NodeData</code> structure is available.
</p>
<p>
The <code>NodeData</code> structure provides two basic methods:
<ul>
	<li><code><b>public &lt;T extends CSSProperty&gt; T getProperty(String name,
			boolean includeInherited)</b></code>, which returns a <code>CSSProperty</code>.
		Basically, these properties are the implementations of the <code>CSSProperty</code> by specialized <code>enums</code>.
		To distinguish between constants values and variable values, following contract is used for the enum values:
		<ul>
			<li>UPPERCASE are the constant values and</li>
			<li>lowercase are the values that contain additional information, 
				which can be retrieved by the following function.</li> 
		</ul> 
	</li>
	<li><code><b>public &lt;T extends Term&lt;?&gt;&gt; T getValue(Class&lt;T&gt; clazz, String name,
			boolean includeInherited);</b></code>
		retrieves a value of type <code>Term</code>, determined in package <code>cz.vutbr.web.css</code>. 		
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
For both these methods, there are equivalent ones defined with automatic inclusion of inherited properties/terms.
</p>
</p>
<p>Example of enum values for the <code>CSSProperty</code> <code>max-height</code>:</p>
<pre>length, percentage, NONE, INHERIT</pre>
<p>
Value <code>INHERIT</code> is present for all properties, <code>length</code> and <code>percentage</code> determine
type of token which is about to be retrieved to get exact information about style
</p>
<p>
For determining the type of the <code>CSSProperty</code>, compiler inference is used. Strictly speaking
that means that the type of L-value(expression at the left side of equal-sign) is used to determine
type to which the result is casted. This could lead in <code>ClassCastException</code> in cases when
the user uses invalid combination of L-value type and property name.
<br/>
When there is no L-value, the supertype (that is <code>CSSProperty</code>) is used to cast the resulting expression.
This is always valid cast. 
</p>

<h2>Simplified and Direct Usage Method</h2>
<p>To provide simpler approach while parsing an (X)HTML document, <code>CSSFactory</code>
provides following method:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code><b>Map&lt;Element, NodeData&gt; assignDOM(Document doc,
			URL base, String medium, boolean useInheritance)</b></code>,
		which directly creates and assigns a <code>NodeData</code> to each element in the
		DOM document <code>doc</code> for the given medium <code>medium</code>. While searching for 
		externally stored CSS style sheets, base URL <code>base</code> is used.
		<br/>
		This method traverses the DOM tree collecting all linked, embedded (&lt;style&gt;) and inline
		 (attribute style=&quot;&quot;) CSS declarations, and assigning them to the DOM elements.		 
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Extending Current Version</h2>
<p>
An extra work was done to simplify the implementation of new CSS standards.
The implementation is defined by interface contracts.
To implement another CSS parsing level, additional work must be done:
<ul>
	<li><code>SupportedCSS</code>, which determines the names of the supported CSS properties,
	and their default values must be replaced with a new implementation. See current
	implementation in <code>cz.vutbr.web.domassign.SupportedCSS21</code> for details.
	The new implementation must be registered in the CSSFactory.</li>
	<li>If new CSS properties were added, their implementations of <code>CSSProperty</code>
	must be added, preferably by enum. <code>DeclarationTransformer</code> must be then informed
	that there are new properties and their conversion methods must be written.
	<br/>
	Please note that in current implementation, there are conversion methods defined 
	for all visual CSS 2.1 properties, but they are missing for aural ones, even if
	<code>CSSProperty</code> implementations  for aural properties are well defined.   
	</li>
	<li>
	If the syntax of CSS significantly changes, grammar files <code>CSS.g</code> and 
	<code>CSSTreeParser.g</code> should be rewritten. In current version, they are written
	in a way that should simplify future migration to the grammar of CSS 3.0 (as seen at specification draft).
	Then new parser should be generated. 
	</li>
	<li>If any changes are done in CSS selectors, the <code>Analyzer</code> must be made aware 
	of these changes for the classification of DOM elements according to their selectors.
	</li>
</ul>  
<h3>Extending Performance</h3>
During the implementation, some additional storage methods have been tested for
<code>NodeData</code> storage considering time and spatial complexity. Current implementation is
a compromise, specialized to lower memory usage.
All parts of the library can be changed to use a different implementation by changing the 
<code>CSSFactory</code>. Other factories that can be replaced are factory for
creating terms (<code>TermFactory</code>) and factory for creating CSS rule parts
(<code>RuleFactory</code>).
