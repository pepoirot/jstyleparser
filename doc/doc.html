<h1>CSSParser</h1>
<p>
CSSParser is Java library, which implements parsing of CSS documents and HTML document
including CSS declarations according to CSS 2.1 specification of W3C. Final result of this parse
is mapping between DOM elements and their CSS declarations. This mapping can be used either to 
display HTML document or to perform some semantic analysis on document CSS structure.
</p>
 
<h2>Internal structure of library</h2>
Code is divided into following packages:
<ol>
	<li><code>cz.vutbr.web.css<code>,</li>
	<li><code>cz.vutbr.web.csskit</code>,</li>
	<li><code>cz.vutbr.web.domassign</code> and</li>
	<li><code>test</code>.
</ol>
<p>
The first package provides in general contracts used in other applications,
the second one its implementation. The third package is about assigning
CSS style-sheet to HTML elements. The last one contains test units.  
</p> 

<h3>Package <code>cz.vutbr.web.css</h3>
<p>
This among interfaces for implementation provides general entry-point 
into CSSParser library. This is in class <code>CSSFactory</code>.
By default, this uses implementation provided by <code>cz.vutbr.csskit</code> package.
</p>
<p>
Next remarkable class in this package is interface <code>CSSProperty</code>, which provides 
contract for CSS properties and by implementing this interface new CSS properties
can be added.
</p>

<h3>Package <code>cz.vutbr.web.csskit</code></h3>
<p>
Provides default implementation of <code>cz.vutbr.web.css</code>. This can be changed by
registering other implementation by calling appropriate methods of <code>CSSFactory</code>. 
</p>
<p>
Internally uses <a href="http://www.antlr.org"">ANTLR</a> to parse CSS input into structures 
defined by contracts in package <code>cz.vutbr.web.css</code>.
</p>

<h3>Package <code>cz.vutbr.web.domassign</code></h3>
<p>
This package provides among others class <code>Analyzer</code>,
which is able sort CSS declaration, to classify them according to CSS medium and
finally to assign them to DOM elements.
</p> 
<p>
The transformation core is done in <code>DeclarationTransformer</code> class.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, this package provides TreeWalker and TreeWalker traversals to simply 
traversing DOM tree obtained by DOM parser, such as <code>Tidy</code> used in 
this implementation.

<h2>Usage guide</h2>
<h3>Retrieving style-sheet structure (<code>StyleSheet</code>)</h3>
<p> 
This functionality should be used only if some advanced work, such as caching of 
result for different medium is desired.
<br/>
Three methods are defined:
<ul>
	<li><code><b>StyleSheet parse(URL url, String encoding)
			throws CSSException, IOException</b></code>, the most general method. 
			Transforms data available at given <code>url</code>, expecting given <code>encoding</code>,
			or taking default one if it is not provided into <code>StyleSheet</code>,			
	</li>
	<li><code><b>StyleSheet parse(String fileName, String encoding)
			throws CSSException, IOException</b></code>, which internally transforms
			<code>fileName</code> into URL and		
	</li>
	<li><code><b>StyleSheet parse(String css) throws IOException,
			CSSException</b></code>, which can be used to parse embedded CSS declarations, 
			that is declarations between &lt;style&gt; tags.
	</li>
</ul>
The resulting <code>StyleSheet</code> is to about be used in <code>Analyzer</code>.
</p>

<h3>Analyzing style-sheet</h3>
When <code>StyleSheet</code> instance is retrieved by previous step, it can be passed to <code>Analyzer</code>.
This object classifies rules into groups by CSS medium and according to their CSS selectors. This operation is done
only once during construction of <code>Analyzer</code> and all subsequent requests are executed on maps created 
during this classification.
<br/>
This will lead to light overhead when only single CSS medium type is used, but greatly improves performance
when one CSS style-sheet has to be analyzer from to point of view of different media.  
</p>
<p>
<code>Analyzer</code> basically provides this function:
<ul>
	<li><code><b>Map&lt;Element, NodeData&gt; evaluateDOM(Document doc, String medium,
			final boolean inherit)</b></code>, which according to give <code>medium</code> and
			allowed/disabled inheritance of declarations constructs map between DOM elements 
			and their CSS declarations. 
	</li>
</ul>  
</p>

<h3>Retrieving values for DOM element</h3>
<p> 
When analyzing part is done for style-sheet, mapping between DOM elements and structure <code>NodeData</code>
is available.
</p>
<p>
<code>NodeData</code> provides in general two methods:
<ul>
	<li><code><b>public &lt;T extends CSSProperty&gt; T getProperty(String name,
			boolean includeInherited)</b></code>, which returns <code>CSSProperty</code>.
		Basically, these properties are implementations of <code>CSSProperty</code> by specialized <code>enums</code>.
		To distinguish between constants values and variable values the following contract is used:
		<ul>
			<li>UPPERCASE, that are constant values and</li>
			<li>lowercase, that are values which contains additional information, 
				which can be retrieved by following function.</li> 
		</ul> 
	</li>
	<li><code><b>public &lt;T extends Term&lt;?&gt;&gt; T getValue(Class&lt;T&gt; clazz, String name,
			boolean includeInherited);</b></code>
		which retrieves value of type <code>Term</code>, determined in package <code>cz.vutbr.web.css</code>. 		
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
For both of this methods, there are defined equivalent ones with automatic inclusion of 
inherited properties/terms.
</p>
</p>
<p>Example of enum values for <code>CSSProperty</code> <code>max-height</code>:</p>
<pre>length, percentage, NONE, INHERIT</pre>
<p>
Value <code>INHERIT</code> is present for all properties, <code>length</code> and <code>percentage</code> determine
type of token which is about to be retrieved to get exact information about style
</p>
<p>
For determining type of <code>CSSProperty</code> compiler inference is used. Strictly speaking,
that means, that type of L-value(expression at the left side of equal-sign) is used to determine
type to which result is casted. This could lead in <code>ClassCastException</code> in cases when
user uses invalid combination of L-value type and name of property.
<br/>
When there is no L-value, supertype, which is <code>CSSProperty</code>, is used to cast resulting
expression, which is always valid cast. 
</p>

<h2>Simplified and direct usage method</h2>
<p>To provide simpler approach while parsing (X)HTML document, <code>CSSFactory</code>
provides method:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code><b>Map&lt;Element, NodeData&gt; assignDOM(Document doc,
			URL base, String medium, boolean useInheritance)</b></code>,
		which directly creates and assigns <code>NodeData</code> to each element in
		DOM document <code>doc</code> for given medium <code>medium</code>. While searching for 
		externally stored CSS style-sheets, base URL <code>base</code> is used.
		<br/>
		This method traverses DOM tree, collecting all linked, embedded (&lt;style&gt;) and in-line
		 (attribute style=&quot;&quot;) CSS declaration, and assign them to DOM elements.		 
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Extending current version</h2>
<p>
An extra work was done to simplify implementation of new CSS standards.
Implementation is defined by interface contracts.
To implement another CSS parsing level, additional work must be done:
<ul>
	<li><code>SupportedCSS</code>, which determines names of supported CSS properties,
	and their default values must be replaced with new implementation. See current
	implementation in <code>cz.vutbr.web.domassign.SupportedCSS21</code> for details.
	That new implementation must be registered at CSSFactory.</li>
	<li>If new CSS properties were added, their implementations of <code>CSSProperty</code>
	must be added, preferably by enum. <code>DeclarationTransformer</code> must be then informed
	that there are new properties and their conversion methods must be written.
	<br/>
	Please note, that in current implementation there are conversion methods defined 
	for all visual CSS 2.1 properties, but they are missing for aural ones, even if
	<code>CSSProperty</code> implementations  for aural properties are well defined.   
	</li>
	<li>
	If syntax of CSS significantly changes, grammar files <code>CSS.g</code> and 
	<code>CSSTreeParser.g</code> should be rewritten. In current version they are written
	in way which should simplify future migration to grammar of CSS 3.0 (as seen at specification draft).
	Then new parser should be generated. 
	</li>
	<li>If any changes are done in CSS selectors, <code>Analyzer</code> must be made aware 
	of this changes while determining classification of DOM elements according to their selectors.
	</li>
</ul>  
<h3>Extending performance</h3>
During implementation some additional storage method were tested for storage
<code>NodeData</code> considering time and spatial complexity. Current implementation is
a compromise, specialized to lower memory usage.
All parts of program can be changed to use different one by changing it in 
<code>CSSFactory</code>. Other factories, which can be replaced are factory for
creating terms (<code>TermFactory</code>) and factory for creating CSS rule parts
(<code>RuleFactory</code>).
